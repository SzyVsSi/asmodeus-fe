				Biblical Prophecies: The Fall of Asmodeus

			<p className='text-xl text-black italic'>
				1. And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and
				brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be
				tormented day and night for ever and ever. <br />â€” Revelation 20:10
			</p>

			<p className='text-xl text-black italic mt-4'>
				2. They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not,
				to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not. <br />â€”
				Deuteronomy 32:17
			</p>

			<p className='text-xl text-black italic mt-4'>
				3. Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring
				lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour. <br />â€” 1 Peter 5:8
			</p>

			<p className='text-xl text-black italic mt-4'>
				4. And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own
				habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto
				the judgment of the great day. <br />â€” Jude 1:6
